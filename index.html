          <p class="textSection">Solera is still early on in its making. It&#x2019s based on a typeface I designed in late 2023 as part of practical research into Frank Blokland&#x2019s doctoral thesis.</p>
          <p class="textSection p2">The project was supervised by Frank himself and the resulting typeface proved suitable for text typesetting but because it was executed digitally in its entirety, it was more mechanical than I wanted it to be.</p>
          <p class="textSection p2">This continuation, working name Solera, aims to breathe humanity into the project by re-designing it on paper with the same original restrictions; the character widths and stem placements are pre-determined and details of characters are designed to balance the typeface without moving sidebearings. This time the design would be anti-mechanical, based predominantly on hand-drawings. No straight lines allowed.</p>
          <p class="textSection p2 extraBottomMargin">Of course, this is just the first step; if the spacing restrictions get in the way of the project, they will be changed.</p>

        <p class="textSection">In the first half of 2023 I read The Origin of the Serif by Edward Catich and immediately started practicing the ancient Roman brush caps. In the second half of the year, an opportunity presented itself: attending the stone carving class in the Type & Media Master's course, overseen by Françoise Berserik.</p>
        <p class="textSection p2">Although the output is still somewhat crude, stone-carving turned out to be great practice for drawing detail and shaping characters through volume, inside-out.</p>
        <p class="textSection p2 extraBottomMargin">I intend to continue working on my existing stones and eventually new ones in my spare time.</p>

      <p class="textSection p2">As I was already developing the roman of Fundamenta at that time, I was asked if I could finish it within 4 weeks, complete with a workable italic. This turned out to be an intense and fast project given that I never designed an italic before.</p>

Some details in the roman are inspired by the work of Frederic W. Goudy and Bram de Does. The italic draws inspiration from de Does, Jan van Krimpen, and several Renaissance punchcutters, notably Francesco Griffo.</p>
